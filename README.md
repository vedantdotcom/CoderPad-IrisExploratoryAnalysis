# CoderPad-IrisExploratoryAnalysis
CoderPad Data Science Question: https://coderpad.io/interview-questions/data-science-interview-questions/

The Iris dataset is a well known, heavily studied dataset hosted for public use by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

Using any analysis method you choose, build either a classifier or produce a data visualization, that shows how the available data can be leveraged to predict the species of Iris.

At minimum, a candidate should be able to conduct a basic analysis showing that they explored the data and found a way to separate the unique characteristics of each flower from the other.

For example:

Does one species of iris have longer petals than the other?
Can the candidate pose questions about the dataset and explore the data for answers to those questions?
Are the methods the candidate uses to explore the data reasonable? This question primarily requires some basic analysis and data visualization.  If a candidate starts off with a more complex approach, there may be a missed opportunity for fast, early lessons from the data, aka “low-hanging fruit.”
Can the candidate support any observations with plots?
How does the candidate form inferences from the data and how well does that candidate apply statistics to defend their inferences?
